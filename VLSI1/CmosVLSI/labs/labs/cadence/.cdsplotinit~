# .cdsplotinit sample file
#
# IMPORTANT****YOU MUST CREATE A SITE SPECIFIC VERSION OF THIS FILE AND
#              LOCATE IT IN EITHER <install_path>/tools/plot, your 
#              working directory, or your home directory.
#
# Format:
#
# <Menu Name>|<model>: \
#      :string type=<string>: \
#      :int type#<int>: \
#      :boolean type: \
#      :paperSize=<quoted string> <int> <int>:
#
# <model>         --- name of the plotter model
#
# <menu name>     --- name to appear on the plotter menu. If there is no
#                     menu name as in the entries in this file then the 
#                     plotter is not recognised in the configuration.
#
# <string>        --- characters contained between '=' and ':'.
#                     ex. =This is the String:
#
# <int>           --- Digits [0-9]
#
# <quoted string> --- characters with double quotes '"' around them.
#                     ex. "The Quoted Sting"
#
# Plotter String Properties:
#
#   type         -- Must contain the plotcap.il entry for this plotter to use.
#   manufacturer  -- Name of the maker of the plotter.
#
# Plotter Boolean Properties:
#
#   compress      - Compressed output is produced.
#   residentFonts - Use the plotter resident fonts instead of stroked fonts.
#
# Plotter Integer Properties:
#
#   maximumPages - Cadence plotting software allows plots to be larger than
#                  the plotter paper.  This is done by creating separate
#                  pages for each piece of the plot.  This allows a limit
#                  to be set for the number of pages.
#
#   resolution   - The number of addressable units per inch.  This is also
#                  known as dots per inch (DPI) or pixels per inch (PPI).
#
#   white,black,red,yellow,green,cyan,blue,magenta
#                - Specifies pen index values for these color hues.  This
#                  allows correct selection of pen colors based on internal
#                  RGB values.
#
# Plotter Paper Sizes:
#
#   paperSize - This defines the phyisical plot area on the paper loaded into
#               the plotter.  It also identifies this by a name specified as
#               a quoted string.  The size is specified in resolution units
#               of the plotter.  If the plotter allows more than one paper
#               size to be loaded this property may be repeated as many
#               times as needed. A width or height of zero "0" denotes an
#               unlimited size in that direction.  Plotters with roll media
#               would use this.
#
#               ex.  :paperSize="A Size" 2400 3150:
#
#                  The width of the plotting area on the paper is 2400 units
#                  The height of the plotting area on the paper is 3150 units.
#                  This paper size is specified as "A Size".
#
#               Some plotters put the origin (0 0) in the lowerleft corner
#               of the paper. These plotters are not able to draw to the
#               origin.  In these cases an offset width and height is 
#               specified to offset the origin to the lower left corner
#               of the plottable area.  The offset numbers are in resolution 
#               units of the plotter.
#
#               ex.  :paperSize="A" 2400 3150 66 75:
#
#                  The offset here is 66 units in the width of 2400 and
#                  75 units in the height of 3150
#                  If the offsets are left off as in the previous example
#                  they are defaulted to (0 0).
#
# Site Specific Properties:
#
#   spool --- The Unix spool command to use to queue the plot data to the
#             plotter. 
#
#             ex. =lpr -Plw:  
#
#             The software will run the following command:
#
#             cat tmpfile1 tmpfile2 tmpfile3 | lpr -Plw
#
#             An option exists to specify where in the spool command to 
#             put the file names.  This is done by adding a "*" to the 
#             command.
#
#             ex. =lpr -Plw *:  
#
#             The software will run the following command:
#
#             lpr -Plw tempfile1 tmpfile2 tmpfile3
#       
#  
#
#   query --- The Unix spool query command that will return information 
#             about the plotters queue. ex. =lpq -Plw:
# 
#   remove -- The Unix spooled job remove command. 
#
#             ex. =lprm -Plw $3:
#
#             The remove command uses a job identifier that is retrieved
#             from the job line returned by the query command.
#
#             The BSD query command is lpq. It returns the following:
#
#             Rank Owner  Job  Files                         Total Size
#             1st  user   6    test.ps                       2782 bytes
#
#             In this case the job identifer used by the remove command is
#             "6" and it is the third field.  When specifying the remove
#             command this is noted by "$3" where 3 denotes the third field.
#
#   instdir - Product 992 and 993 installation directory.  This is the 
#             path to the installation directory with respect to the plot
#             host computer.
#
#   tmpdir -- Product 992 and 993 temporary directory.  This is where
#             products 992 and 993 put their temporary files.
#
#   outtype - Product 992 can output the following formats:
#               RASTER   --  Banded raster data (Large disk Low memory)
#               FM_RASTER -  Frame Buffer raster data (Low disk Large memory)
#               RPM_VCGL --  Versatec Vector data requiring Versatec Controller
#               RPM_VRF  --  Older Versatec Vector data requireing Versatec
#                            Controller.
#               BLOCKED_RASTER - Raster data written to disk file and output
#                                upon completion of plot.  (Better Quality
#                                Plots when data is dense)
#
#   script -- The path name to a shell script to run upon completion of the
#             plot from procucts 992 and 993.  The script is passed the
#             name of the plotter ready data file as the first argument.
#
#             ex.  :script=moveplot myplotter:
#
#             The command that gets run is:
#
#             moveplot /usr/tmp/plotterfilename myplotter username
#
#             An option exists to specify where in the script command to 
#             put the file name.  This is done by adding a "*" to the 
#             command.
#
#             ex.  :script=moveplot myplotter *:
#
#             The software will run the following command:
#
#             moveplot myplotter /usr/tmp/plotterfilename username
#
#             ( Optional, if not specified then data is directed to plot
#               device. )
